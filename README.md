# react_webpack_demo
This is my first webpack-based react app.

So couple days ago, one of my firneds told me that I still should learn how to create a react project from scratch.
Even Vite is getting more papular for building a project, learning webpack is still a benifit.
Therefore, I took his advice gratefully, started my journey to dive into this package tool.
Probaly not gonna be a master of it, but hope that next time if someone ask me that do I know this tool, I can say enough to start a project from scrath.

Also, I will do ant design in this project since it's also getting papular I guess?
Even I dont get this job, it's still worth to learn new tools.
I mean no one's gonna blame you for knowing more things, right?
